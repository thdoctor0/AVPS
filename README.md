# About AVPS
## Uses Julia as a language which julia is known for :
Great at mathematics
Good for machine learning algorithms
Very fast as a programming language so fast updates
An implementation of C, Ruby, Python, R and more into one fast language.

## Very good as an optimisation
### Uses technologies such as
- Near pixel neighbours
 Gets nearest pixels RGB values and converts them into more

Ex : RED AND BLUE

RED,RGB = 255,0,0
BLUE,RGB = 0,0,255
RED AND BLUE = 255,0,255

This enhances graphics by using pixel variations
- Quantum proccesing simulator
- and much more
